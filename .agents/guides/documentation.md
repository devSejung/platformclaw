# Documentation and release-note contracts

Read before documentation/instruction edits, publishing/i18n, changelog generation, or release-note wording. Read this guide in full. The [root policy](../../AGENTS.md) owns hard gates, task routing, and validation-environment selection. Paths and commands here are relative to the repository root.

## Docs

- Source docs: `docs/**`; publish repo: `openclaw/docs`; host: `https://docs.openclaw.ai`.
- Flow: source -> `docs-sync-publish.yml` -> mirror build -> R2 -> Worker router.
- Docs AI: `openclaw/ask-molty`; see its `AGENTS.md`.

## Docs / Changelog

- Use `$technical-documentation` for docs writing/review. Docs change with behavior/API.
- Codex harness upgrade (`extensions/codex/package.json` `@openai/codex`): refresh `docs/plugins/codex-harness.md` model snapshot from the new harness `model/list`.
- Docs final answers: include relevant full `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` URL(s). If issue/PR work too, GitHub URL last.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: release-only. Do not edit for normal PRs, direct `main` fixes, or `ship it`; release generation owns it. Do not ask contributors/agents for changelog edits.
- User-facing `fix`/`feat`/`perf`: put release-note context in PR body, squash message, or direct commit: behavior, surface, issue/PR refs, credited human author/reporter.
- Release generation: derive `CHANGELOG.md` from merged PRs + all direct `main` commits. Entries: active `### Changes`/`### Fixes`, single-line, thank credited humans; never thank bots/forbidden handles: `@openclaw`, `@clawsweeper`, `@codex`, `@steipete`.
